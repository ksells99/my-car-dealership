# MyCarDealership

MyCarDealership is a stock management application designed for car dealerships, allowing them to keep track of vehicle stock and view a summary via an intuitive dashboard. Dealerships can sign up for a free account and add/manage their stock collection.

The application was built using Angular, and uses Firebase for the back-end. This was also the first time I have used Chart.js along with the Google Maps API, the former showing a breakdown of unsold vehicle stock and the latter pin-pointing the dealership's location on the map. I have also used the LocationIQ API in order to convert string addresses entered by the user into lat/long values that can be read by the Google Maps API.

The app is deployed on Firebase Hosting and can be accessed here:
